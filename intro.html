        <p>One Day International is a form of limited overs cricket, in which each team faces a fixed number of overs, usually 50, played between two international representative teams, each having ODI status, as determined by the International Cricket Council (ICC). The first ODI was played on 5 January 1971 between Australia and England at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.[1] India is a full member of International Cricket Council and has a permanent ODI status. India played their first ODI in 1974 and a total of 227 players have represented the team. Since 1974 India has played 978 ODIs, resulting in 509 victories, 419 defeats, 9 ties and 41 no results.[2] India registered their first series victory against England in a 3-match series by 2–1 in 1981.[3] India won the Cricket World Cup twice in 1983 and 2011 and was runner-up in 2003. India won the ICC Champions Trophy in the year 2013 and had earlier shared once with Sri Lanka in 2002 because rain washed out the attempt to complete the final twice. India was also runner-up in 2000.[4] India have won the Asia Cup (in ODI format) a total of six times in 1984, 1988, 1990, 1995, 2010 and 2018.[5]</p>
